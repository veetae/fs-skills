| `universal-data-scoping-and-decoration` | Where to put data (user vs page vs element vs event) |

### Industry-Specific Skills (7)

Tailored guidance for specific verticals:

| Industry | Skill | Key Focus Areas |
|----------|-------|-----------------|
| **Banking & Financial Services** | `fullstory-banking` | PCI DSS, GLBA, SOX; transaction masking; MFA flows |
| **E-commerce & Retail** | `fullstory-ecommerce` | Conversion funnels; cart abandonment; product tracking |
| **Gaming** | `fullstory-gaming` | Fraud detection; responsible gaming compliance; game iframe decoration; KYC/AML |

### Framework Integration Skills (1)

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `fullstory-stable-selectors` | Universal pattern for stable `data-*` attributes across ALL frameworks |

> **Why Stable Selectors?** Modern CSS tools (CSS Modules, styled-components, Tailwind) generate dynamic class names that change every build. Stable `data-*` attributes ensure Fullstory searches, defined elements, and click maps work reliably across deployments.

#### CUA Readiness (Computer User Agents)

The stable selectors skill prepares your application for AI-driven automation:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Without Stable Selectors (Brittle)                              │
│  AI sees: <button class="sc-abc123 xyz789">                      │
│  → Class names change every build, AI navigation breaks         │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  With Stable Selectors (Resilient)                               │
│  AI sees: <button data-component="Checkout" data-element="pay"> │
│  → Semantic, stable, machine-readable forever                   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### Framework Coverage

This single skill **replaces the legacy React plugins** (`fullstory-babel-plugin-annotate-react`, `eslint-plugin-annotate-react`) with framework-agnostic guidance:

| Framework | Supported |
|-----------|-----------|
| React / Next.js (App Router, RSC) | ✅ |
| Angular | ✅ |
| Vue.js / Nuxt | ✅ |
| Svelte / SvelteKit | ✅ |
| Qwik / Solid / Astro | ✅ |
| Vanilla JS / Web Components | ✅ |
| Server-rendered (PHP, Django, Rails) | ✅ |

No external plugins required—just add `data-component` and `data-element` attributes to your markup.

## 🏭 Industry Privacy Comparison

Different industries have vastly different requirements for Fullstory implementation:

### Private by Default Recommendation

Fullstory offers a **Private by Default mode** that inverts the capture default—everything is masked unless explicitly unmasked. This is the recommended approach for high-sensitivity industries:

| Industry | Private by Default? | Rationale |
|----------|---------------------|-----------|
| **Banking** | ✅ **Highly recommended** | Financial data, regulatory requirements |
| **Healthcare** | ✅ **Required** | HIPAA PHI protection |
| **SaaS (Enterprise)** | ⚠️ **Recommended** | Customer data in multi-tenant apps |
| **Gaming** | ⚠️ **Consider** | Financial + responsible gaming data |
| **Travel** | ⚠️ **Consider** | Passport, payment data |
| **E-commerce** | ❌ Usually not needed | Product data should be visible |
| **Media** | ❌ Usually not needed | Content data is the analytics |

> **Enable Private by Default**: Contact [Fullstory Support](https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) or select during account setup.
> 
> **Reference**: [Fullstory Private by Default](https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360044349073-Fullstory-Private-by-Default)

### Privacy Defaults by Industry

| Industry | Default Privacy Mode | Financial Data | User Content | Conversion Tracking | Primary Concern |
|----------|---------------------|----------------|--------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| **Banking** | Exclude | Exclude (ranges only) | Exclude | Limited | Regulatory (PCI, GLBA) |
| **E-commerce** | Unmask | Capture (orders) | Mostly capture | Rich | Conversion optimization |
| **Gaming** | Mixed | Exclude (ranges only) | Exclude | Careful | Responsible gaming |
| **Healthcare** | Exclude | Exclude | Exclude | Very limited | HIPAA compliance |
| **SaaS** | Unmask | Usually OK | Mask/Consider | Rich | Feature adoption |
| **Travel** | Unmask | Capture (bookings) | Mask | Rich | Booking optimization |
| **Media** | Unmask | N/A | Capture | Rich | Engagement metrics |

### What to Capture by Industry

| Data Type | Banking | E-commerce | Gaming | Healthcare | SaaS | Travel | Media |
|-----------|---------|------------|----------|------------|------|--------|-------|
| User names | ❌ | ⚠️ Mask | ⚠️ Mask | ❌ | ⚠️ Mask | ⚠️ Mask | ⚠️ Mask |
| Email | ❌ | ⚠️ Hash | ⚠️ Hash | ❌ | ⚠️ Consider | ⚠️ Mask | ⚠️ Consider |
| Product/content names | N/A | ✅ | ✅ | N/A | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Prices/amounts | ❌ Ranges | ✅ | ❌ Ranges | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Account balance | ❌ | N/A | ❌ | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| Transaction details | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Search queries | ⚠️ | ✅ | ⚠️ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Payment cards | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Government IDs | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

**Legend**: ✅ = Capture, ⚠️ = Consider/Mask, ❌ = Exclude

### Key Regulatory Requirements

| Industry | Primary Regulations | Fullstory Requirements |
|----------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| **Banking** | PCI DSS, GLBA, SOX | Exclude all financial data; use ranges |
| **E-commerce** | PCI DSS, CCPA, GDPR | Exclude payment fields; consent for EU |
| **Gaming** | Gaming licenses, AML/KYC | Never analyze gaming patterns; exclude amounts |
| **Healthcare** | HIPAA, HITECH | BAA required; exclude ALL PHI; masking insufficient |
| **SaaS** | SOC 2, GDPR | Enterprise privacy options; consent for EU |
| **Travel** | PCI DSS, GDPR | Exclude passport/ID numbers; payment exclusion |
| **Media** | COPPA, GDPR | Never track children's profiles; consent |

- [Privacy (Help Center)](https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020623574)

### Legal Disclaimers

All industry-specific skills contain regulatory guidance for educational purposes only. This guidance **does not constitute legal advice**. Regulations (PCI DSS, HIPAA, GDPR, GLBA, etc.) are:
- Complex and nuanced
- Jurisdiction-specific
- Subject to change

**Always consult with your legal and compliance teams** before implementing data capture solutions.

### Build Tool Warning

Modern CSS build tools (Tailwind, PostCSS purge, CSS Modules) may remove "unused" classes. Privacy classes like `.fs-exclude`, `.fs-mask`, `.fs-unmask` must be:
1. Safelisted in your build configuration
2. Verified in production HTML
3. Tested in Fullstory to confirm they work

### Security Notes

- **Client-side hashing** is NOT a security control - it's a privacy measure only
- CSS classes can be inspected by users
- Always use server-side processing for true security requirements
